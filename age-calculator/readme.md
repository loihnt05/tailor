# Age Calculator

- A form that allows users to input their birthdate using a JavaScript datepicker (avoid the default HTML date picker)
- Use the Luxon library to calculate the exact age in years, months, and days
- Display the result on the same page after the user submits the form
- Implement basic validation to ensure the birthdate is valid
- Use simple styling to make the calculator visually appealing and responsive
